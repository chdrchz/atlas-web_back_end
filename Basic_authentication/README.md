# Authentication Learning Project

This project focuses on understanding various authentication concepts, specifically **Basic Authentication** and encoding using **Base64**. By the end of this project, you will be able to explain these concepts confidently.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you should be able to:

### General

- Understand what **authentication** means.
- Know what **Base64** is.
- Encode a string using **Base64**.
- Understand what **Basic authentication** means.
- Send an **Authorization header**.

## Requirements

### Python Scripts

- All scripts will be interpreted/compiled on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using **Python 3.9**.
- All files should:
  - End with a new line.
  - Begin with the line: `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.
  - Be executable.
- A `README.md` file is required at the root of the project folder.
- Code should conform to **pycodestyle** (version 2.5).
- The length of files will be tested using `wc`.

### Documentation

- All modules, classes, and functions should have comprehensive documentation:
  - **Modules** should have a docstring describing their purpose:
    ```python
    python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'
    ```
  - **Classes** should have a docstring explaining their role:
    ```python
    python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'
    ```
  - **Functions** (inside and outside classes) should have a docstring explaining their purpose:
    ```python
    python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'
    python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'
    ```
- Documentation should be a complete sentence explaining the purpose of the module, class, or method, and its length will be verified.
