- 0x0B Redis Basic
A basic introduction to using Redis as an in-memory data structure store. This project covers setting up Redis, creating and retrieving data, and managing cache operations.

- Basic Authentication
Implements basic authentication mechanisms, focusing on user login, password hashing, and secure storage. It covers fundamental security principles for authenticating users in web applications.

- ES6 Basics
An introduction to ES6 syntax and features, including let/const, arrow functions, template literals, and destructuring. Essential knowledge for modern JavaScript development.

- ES6 Classes
This project explores JavaScript ES6 Classes for creating and managing object-oriented structures, focusing on encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

- ES6 Data Manipulation
Learn how to manipulate and transform data using ES6 features such as map, reduce, and filter. This project is geared towards efficient data handling in modern JavaScript.

- ES6 Promises
A guide to handling asynchronous operations with JavaScript Promises. It covers creation, chaining, and error handling to ensure reliable async code execution.

- MySQL Advanced
Delve into advanced MySQL topics, including complex queries, indexing, and stored procedures, to enhance database performance and capability.

- NoSQL
An introduction to NoSQL databases, their data models, and query methods, including working with document-based databases like MongoDB and understanding schema-less design.

- Node.js
Explores Node.js fundamentals for backend development, covering core modules, event-driven programming, and basic server setup to handle HTTP requests.

- Session Authentication
Implementation of session-based authentication for managing user sessions securely, including creating, managing, and deleting sessions.

- Unit and Integration Tests
Covers unit testing and integration testing concepts using popular testing frameworks. Learn to ensure code reliability by testing individual functions and their interactions.

- Caching
A project focused on implementing caching strategies to improve application performance, exploring memory caching, and persistent caching using Redis.

- Pagination
Learn how to implement pagination for handling large datasets, including designing endpoints to serve paginated data and optimizing database queries.

- Personal Data Management
This project focuses on handling and securing personal data, exploring techniques like encryption and secure data storage practices.

- Python Async Comprehension
Explores Pythonâ€™s async comprehensions for handling asynchronous generators, offering an efficient way to handle async data manipulation.

- Python Async Functions
An introduction to async functions in Python, covering async/await syntax, event loops, and non-blocking I/O for asynchronous programming.

- Python Variable Annotations
Covers Python variable annotations for improving code readability and using type hints, a feature introduced in Python 3.6.

- Queuing System in JavaScript
A basic implementation of a queuing system in JavaScript, managing asynchronous tasks in a FIFO order for task scheduling.

- Unit Tests in JavaScript
Focuses on unit testing JavaScript code using testing frameworks like Jest or Mocha, ensuring individual components function correctly.

- User Authentication Service
A complete user authentication service, covering user registration, login, session management, and securing endpoints.
