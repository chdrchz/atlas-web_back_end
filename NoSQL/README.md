# Introduction to NoSQL Databases with MongoDB and Python

This project delves into the world of NoSQL databases, specifically focusing on MongoDB and its interaction with Python. By the end, you'll gain a solid understanding of:

- **NoSQL Fundamentals**: What it is, how it differs from SQL, ACID properties, document storage, and NoSQL types.
- **NoSQL Benefits**: Advantages of using NoSQL databases over traditional SQL counterparts.
- **MongoDB Basics**: How to query, insert, update, and delete information within MongoDB.
- **MongoDB and Python**: Utilizing Python scripts to interact with a MongoDB database.

## Learning Resources:

The project provides a curated list of resources to guide your learning journey:

- **Read/Watch**: Links to articles and video tutorials that explain NoSQL, MongoDB, and its interaction with Python.
- **MongoDB Command File**: A file containing commands for practicing basic CRUD operations within the MongoDB shell.
- **Python Scripts**: Python scripts demonstrating data interaction with a MongoDB database.

## Project Requirements:

- **File Format**: All files should end with a new line and begin with a comment line (`// my comment`).
- **File Naming**: All files should have a `.js` (JavaScript) extension for MongoDB command files and `.py` (Python) extension for Python scripts.
- **README**: A comprehensive `README.md` file is required at the project's root directory.
- **MongoDB Installation**: Ensure you have MongoDB version 4.4 installed on your Ubuntu 20.04 LTS system. Refer to the provided installation guide if needed.
- **Python Environment**: Set up a Python 3.9 environment with PyMongo version 4.8.0 installed for running the Python scripts.
- **Code Style**: Adhere to the pycodestyle (version 2.5.\*) code style guidelines for Python scripts.
- **Code Documentation**: All modules and functions should have clear and concise docstrings to enhance code readability and maintainability.
- **Import Safety**: Use the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block to prevent code execution when the script is imported as a module.

## Project Deliverables:

- **Completed MongoDB Command File**: A well-structured `.js` file containing commands that demonstrate basic CRUD operations within the MongoDB shell.
- **Functional Python Scripts**: Well-written Python scripts showcasing interaction with your MongoDB database using the PyMongo library.
- **Comprehensive README**: A detailed `README.md` file documenting the project structure, learning resources, installation instructions, and usage guidelines.

## Project Completion:

Upon completing the project, you'll possess the knowledge and skills to explain NoSQL concepts, utilize MongoDB effectively, and interact with a MongoDB database using Python scripts.

This project provides a strong foundation for further exploration of NoSQL databases and their applications. Feel free to experiment and expand your knowledge based on the provided resources!
