# Unittests and Integration Tests

This project aims to provide an in-depth understanding of testing in Python, specifically focusing on the difference between **unit tests** and **integration tests**, along with common testing patterns such as **mocking**, **parametrizations**, and **fixtures**. The project follows Python's best practices and coding standards, ensuring clean and well-documented code.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Clearly explain the difference between **unit tests** and **integration tests**.
- Apply common testing patterns, including:
  - **Mocking**: Creating mock objects to test components in isolation.
  - **Parametrizations**: Running the same test with different inputs.
  - **Fixtures**: Setting up and cleaning up data or environment for tests.

## Project Requirements

- All files will be interpreted/compiled on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using **Python 3.9**.
- Ensure all files end with a new line.
- The first line of every file must be `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project is mandatory.
- Your code should conform to **pycodestyle** (version 2.5).
- All files must be executable.
- All modules, classes, and functions must include detailed **documentation** explaining their purpose.
- All functions and coroutines must include **type annotations**.
